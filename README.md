# AIPower

AIPower is a **React + Vite** single-page application (SPA) designed to explore creative front-end engineering patterns with **AI-inspired UI motion**. The project demonstrates modern **component-driven architecture**, **responsive design**, and **dynamic visual depth** using parallax animations and bento grid layouts â€” delivering an elegant, interactive user experience.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Dynamic Parallax Animations:** Mouse-based and scroll-triggered motion effects enhance visual depth.
- **Gradient Styling & Bento Grids:** Complex UI geometry built with Tailwindâ€™s utility classes and grid-based layouts.
- **Mobile-First SPA:** Optimized for responsiveness across devices.
- **Component-Driven Architecture:** Built with modular React components for scalability and reusability.
- **Fast Development Pipeline:** Powered by Vite for lightning-fast bundling and HMR (Hot Module Replacement).
